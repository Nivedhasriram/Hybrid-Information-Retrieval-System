77,a comparative analysis of the performance of long range hypervelocity vehicles .,"a comparative analysis of the performance of long range hypervelocity vehicles . long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in unpowered flight . powered flight is analyzed for an idealized propulsion system which rather closely approaches present-day rocket motors . unpowered flight is characterized by a return to earth along a ballistic, skip, or glide trajectory . only those trajectories are treated which yield the maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight . aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner similar to that employed previously by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047), with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles . the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the several types studied in the sense that it generally requires the highest velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range . this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat transfer to the re-entry body through the artifice of increasing pressure drag in relation to friction drag - that is, by using a blunt body . thus the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved . the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood of and greater than 4 is far superior to the ballistic vehicle in ability to convert velocity into range . it has the disadvantage of having far more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage that this heat can in the main be radiated back to the atmosphere . consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low . the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in converting velocity into range . at lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to be about equal to comparable ballistic vehicles while at lift-drag ratios",compar analysi perform long rang hyperveloc vehicl long rang hyperveloc vehicl studi term motion power flight motion aerodynam heat unpow flight power flight analyz ideal propuls system rather close approach present day rocket motor unpow flight character return earth along ballist skip glide trajectori trajectori treat yield maximum rang given veloc end power flight aerodynam heat treat manner similar employ previous senior author studi ballist missil naca tn 4047 except radiant well convect heat transfer consid connect glide skip vehicl ballist vehicl found least effici sever type studi sens gener requir highest veloc end power flight order attain given rang disadvantag may offset howev reduc convect heat transfer entri bodi artific increas pressur drag relat friction drag use blunt bodi thu kinet energi requir vehicl end power flight may reduc minim mass coolant materi involv glide vehicl develop lift drag ratio neighborhood greater far superior ballist vehicl abil convert veloc rang disadvantag far heat convect howev compens advantag heat main radiat back atmospher consequ mass coolant materi may kept rel low skip vehicl develop lift drag ratio found superior compar ballist glide vehicl convert veloc rang lift drag ratio found equal compar ballist vehicl lift drag ratio

(a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/ compared to diffusion across streamlines . in either case the gas density near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the more familiar case of moderate temperature differences . in fact, in case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution . in order to illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a spherical segment . in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced by the schmidt number . the simplifications introduced in case (a) are also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium is given by..

140,the determination of turbulent skin friction by means of pitot tubes .,"the determination of turbulent skin friction by means of pitot tubes . a simple method of determining local turbulent skin friction on a smooth surface has been developed which utilises a round pitot tube resting on the surface . assuming the existence of a region near the surface in which conditions are functions only of the skin friction, the relevant physical constants of the fluid and a suitable length, a universal non-dimensional relation is obtained for the difference between the total pressure recorded by the tube and the static pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin friction . this relation, on this assumption, is independent of the pressure gradient . the truth and form of the relation were first established, to a considerable degree of accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically similar round pitot tubes--the diameter being taken as representative length . these four pitot tubes were then used to determine the local skin friction coefficient at three stations on a wind tunnel wall, under varying conditions of pressure gradient . at each station, within the limits of experimental accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was found to be the same for each pitot tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and leaving little doubt as to the correctness of the skin friction so found . pitot traverses were then made in the pipe and in the boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall . the results were plotted in two non-dimensional forms on the basis already suggested and they fell close together in a region whose outer limit represented the breakdown of the basic assumption, but close to the wall the results spread out, due to the unknown displacement of the effective centre of a pitot tube near a wall . this again provides further evidence of the existence of a region of local dynamical similarity and of the correctness of the skin friction deduced from measurements with round pitot tubes on the wind tunnel wall . the extent of the region in which the local dynamical similarity may be expected to hold appears to vary from about to of the boundary-layer thickness for conditions remote from, and close to, separation respectively .",determin turbul skin friction mean pitot tube simpl method determin local turbul skin friction smooth surfac develop utilis round pitot tube rest surfac assum exist region near surfac condit function skin friction relev physic constant fluid suitabl length univers non dimension relat obtain differ total pressur record tube static pressur wall term skin friction relat assumpt independ pressur gradient truth form relat first establish consider degre accuraci pipe use four geometr similar round pitot tube diamet taken repres length four pitot tube use determin local skin friction coeffici three station wind tunnel wall vari condit pressur gradient station within limit experiment accuraci deduc skin friction coeffici found pitot tube thu confirm basic assumpt leav littl doubt correct skin friction found pitot travers made pipe boundari layer wind tunnel wall result plot two non dimension form basi alreadi suggest fell close togeth region whose outer limit repres breakdown basic assumpt close wall result spread due unknown displac effect centr pitot tube near wall provid evid exist region local dynam similar correct skin friction deduc measur round pitot tube wind tunnel wall extent region local dynam similar may expect hold appear vari boundari layer thick condit remot close separ respect

(1) near the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream of the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent of core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximately increasing mach and or reynolds number . at distances greater than 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the maximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until the turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching similarity . (2) the lateral and longitudinal scales of turbulence are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds number and in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally with distance from the jet nozzle . (3) farther downstream of the jet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreases approximately linearly with distance . (4) near the nozzle the lateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not vary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal scale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of about mum moves out from the centerline .

219,on the strength distribution of noise sources along a jet .,"on the strength distribution of noise sources along a jet . the spatial distribution of noise sources along a jet is investigated by application of lighthill's theory to regions of 'similar' profiles . the analysis refers to the noise power emitted by a 'slice' of jet (section between two adjacent planes normal to the axis) as a function of distance x of the slice from the nozzle . it is found that this power is essentially constant with x in the initial mixing region (x law), then further downstream (say 8 or 10 diameters from the nozzle) falls off extremely fast (x law or faster) in the fully developed jet . because of this striking attenuation of strength with distance, it is concluded that the mixing region produces the bulk of the noise and must dominate in muffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat' part of the jet must contribute much less to the total noise power than is commonly supposed . powell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocity profile on total noise power are interpreted qualitatively . the behavior of multiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers, both as to overall quieting and frequency-shifting, is also interpreted in the light of the results . the possibility emerges that such mufflers may be improved without serious thrust loss by the addition of a sound-attenuating shroud .",strength distribut nois sourc along jet spatial distribut nois sourc along jet investig applic lighthil theori region similar profil analysi refer nois power emit slice jet section two adjac plane normal axi function distanc slice nozzl found power essenti constant initi mix region law downstream say 10 diamet nozzl fall extrem fast law faster fulli develop jet strike attenu strength distanc conclud mix region produc bulk nois must domin muffler behavior convers fat part jet must contribut much less total nois power commonli suppos powel experi effect nozzl veloc profil total nois power interpret qualit behavior multipl nozzl corrug muffler overal quiet frequenc shift also interpret light result possibl emerg muffler may improv without seriou thrust loss addit sound attenu shroud

257,on turbulen flow between parallel plates .,"on turbulen flow between parallel plates . the reynolds equations of motion of turbulent flow of incompressible fluid have been studied for turbulent flow between parallel plates . the number of these equations is finally reduced to two . one of these consists of mean velocity and correlation between transverse and longitudinal turbulent-velocity fluctuations only . the other consists of the mean pressure and transverse turbulent-velocity intensity . some conclusions about the mean pressure distribution and turbulent fluctuations are drawn . these equations are applied to two special cases .. one is poiseuille flow in which both plates are at rest and the other is couette flow in which one plate is at rest and the other is moving with constant velocity . the mean velocity distribution and the correlation can be expressed in a form of polynomial of the co-ordinate in the direction perpendicular to the plates, with the ratio of shearing stress on the plate to that of the corresponding laminar flow of the same maximum velocity as a parameter . these expressions hold true all the way across the plates, i.e., both the turbulent region and viscous layer including the laminar sublayer . these expressions for poiseuille flow have been checked with experimental data of laufer fairly well . it also shows that the logarithmic mean velocity distribution is not a rigorous solution of reynolds equations .",turbulen flow parallel plate reynold equat motion turbul flow incompress fluid studi turbul flow parallel plate number equat final reduc two one consist mean veloc correl transvers longitudin turbul veloc fluctuat consist mean pressur transvers turbul veloc intens conclus mean pressur distribut turbul fluctuat drawn equat appli two special case one poiseuil flow plate rest couett flow one plate rest move constant veloc mean veloc distribut correl express form polynomi co ordin direct perpendicular plate ratio shear stress plate correspond laminar flow maximum veloc paramet express hold true way across plate turbul region viscou layer includ laminar sublay express poiseuil flow check experiment data laufer fairli well also show logarithm mean veloc distribut rigor solut reynold equat

262,the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion .,"the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion . this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year . the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur . in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space . the practical question which required an answer was .. would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas .qm this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated . an ideal problem is here discussed . a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form . the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated . it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air . the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front . as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases to be accurate . at 20 atm. 45 of the energy has been degraded into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expanding against atmospheric pressure . this leads to the prediction that an atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as a blast-producer, as a high explosive releasing the same amount of energy . in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is proportional to r, and comparison with the measured pressures near high explosives, in the range of radii where the two might be expected to be comparable, shows that these conclusions are borne out by experiment .",format blast wave intens explos paper written earli 1941 circul civil defenc research committe ministri home secur june year present writer told might possibl produc bomb larg amount energi would releas nuclear fission name atom bomb use work describ repres first attempt form idea mechan effect might expect explos could occur common explos bomb mechan effect produc sudden gener larg amount ga high temperatur confin space practic question requir answer would similar effect produc energi could releas highli concentr form unaccompani gener ga qm paper declassifi though supersed complet calcul seem appropri publish first written without alter except omiss line addit summari comparison recent experiment work write later worker field may appreci ideal problem discuss finit amount energi suddenli releas infinit concentr form motion pressur surround air calcul found spheric shock wave propag outward whose radiu relat time sinc explos start equat atmospher densiti energi releas calcul function ratio specif heat air effect explos forc air within shock front thin shell insid front front expand maximum pressur decreas till 10 atm analysi ceas accur 20 atm 45 energi degrad heat avail work use expand atmospher pressur lead predict atom bomb would half effici blast produc high explos releas amount energi ideal problem maximum pressur proport comparison measur pressur near high explos rang radii two might expect compar show conclus born experi

272,oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory .,"oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory . the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for conducting boundary-layer transition experiments . the use of the shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles . boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) . transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on the model surface . the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere . this implies that transition first occurred in the sonic region . the transition reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 . transition occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 . the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel . the transition reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments . the results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 . that is, the transition reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary- layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000 based on local external properties and a distance along the body surface from the stagnation point) . the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer cooling . that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the hemisphere-cylinder . also, the increase in transition reynolds number with an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .",oscillatori aerodynam coeffici

315,scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .,"scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments . the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in how they behave after separation . for turbulent boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially . the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface . the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible . several methods which can be used to fix transition are described, and the results obtained by using them are compared . in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement is found, and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur . several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples . in particular, special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0.1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings) . the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge . under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice . more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully . in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock, and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory .",scale effect high subson transon speed method fix transit model experi major scale effect high subson transon speed aris differ condit laminar turbul boundari layer separ behav separ turbul boundari layer condit behaviour vari greatli reynold number chang mani exampl shown similar turbul layer occur natur high reynold number boundari layer transit turbul flow fix artifici scale effect aris wind tunnel test made low reynold number may therefor often minimis fix transit turbul flow introduc artifici disturb produc excresc attach surfac fact effect separ often less sever laminar layer turbul layer like encount full scale make import whenev possibl sever method use fix transit describ result obtain use compar gener experi two dimension flow good agreement found explan advanc case discrep occur sever uncertainti difficulti aris fix transit discuss illustr exampl particular special care need interpret result obtain transit fix low reynold number say less 10 base local chord wing thick chord ratio possibl higher reynold number thinner wing difficulti fix transit satisfactorili increas three dimension wing particularli swept back highli taper small chord reynold number near tip test cover larg rang incid includ high incid flow may separ close lead edg circumst frequent necessari place excresc differ chordwis posit low high angl incid inconveni practic research need sound recommend made transit fix model particularli sinc routin test often possibl check effect transit fix fulli section deal three dimension test exampl given spuriou result avoid success fix transit condit even low reynold number artifici fix transit may necessari give turbul boundari layer ahead shock condit doubt whether method use fix transit satisfactori

329,various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied gas flow .,"various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied gas flow . this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply . results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of continuum theory . based on theoretical and experimental evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition . this model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities . in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes of problems .. a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/ class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction . for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundary . here, the use of the navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified . for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions . a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis . in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction . for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems . solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region . to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful approximation at hypersonic speeds . to illustrate the merged layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere using the incipient merged layer approximation . results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed . with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease . calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy . for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere . the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory . a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations . qualitative agreement is indicated .",variou aerodynam characterist hyperson rarefi ga flow paper consid problem calcul viscou aerodynam characterist blunt bodi hyperson speed suffici high altitud

(1) sharp leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal shock wave . the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly curved . consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature, and the vorticity there is not zero . the effects of this shock-wave larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory, and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the framework of that theory . the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave influence is found to be appreciable . for the case of the blunt leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this parameter . these approximate results show that the influence of the leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical and experimental study .",influenc lead edg shock wave laminar boundari layer hyperson speed order bring import lead edg region hyperson speed influenc lead edg shock wave laminar boundari layer investig two simpl case steadi flow semi infinit insul flat plate sharp lead edg blunt lead edg approxim normal shock wave streamlin enter boundari layer larg region plate surfac previous cross shock wave near lead edg shock strong highli curv consequ temperatur outer edg boundari layer appreci higher free stream temperatur vortic zero effect shock wave larger usual error made boundari layer theori estim effect therefor obtain within framework theori numer magnitud shock wave influenc found appreci case blunt lead edg slope curv induc pressur plot hyperson interact paramet close approach experiment data hammitt bogdonoff obtain helium larg valu paramet approxim result show influenc lead edg region hyperson speed requir care theoret experiment studi

(for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same quart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .) the stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in detail . the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion of stability due to heisenberg .. if a velocity profile has an number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds number is sufficiently large . this destabilizing effect of viscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical significance is carefully discussed . the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called neutral curve for the two characteristic types of velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and the symmetrical profile . the asymptotic behavior of the neutral curve is discussed first . the main difference between profiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two branches of the neutral curve approach and for profiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile without a flex . the most important results are as follows . for sufficiently large reynolds number r . (2) there always exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable . a similar result was obtained by synge from energy considerations . synge found a limiting curve below which the motion is necessarily stable . the author's discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers . hence the qualitative shape of the curve is determined . the author proceeds to show that simple approximate expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his general analysis for a given velocity profile . these approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 . the reynolds numbers are based on the width of the channel and the displacement thickness, respectively . finally, the method for computing the complete instability curve is presented and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked out in detail . the stability limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting . the present more exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned . the value found here is r=420 . the neutral curve for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before . the minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 . the agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned above is thus very good . a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous effects and of future developments concludes the paper .",stabil two dimension parallel flow last part author theori stabil plane laminar motion part cf quart 117 142 218 234 1945 rev 225 226 stabil charact viscou fluid consid detail author proce first give proof criterion stabil due heisenberg veloc profil number phase veloc disturb wave number unstabl real fluid reynold number suffici larg destabil effect viscos one interest phenomena gener stabil theori physic mathemat signific care discuss author discuss behavior call neutral curv two characterist type veloc distribut boundari layer type profil symmetr profil asymptot behavior neutral curv discuss first main differ profil without point inflect two branch neutral curv approach profil flex converg profil without flex import result follow suffici larg reynold number alway exist minimum motion stabl similar result obtain syng energi consider syng found limit curv motion necessarili stabl author discuss asymptot behavior curv show alway exist maximum valu beyond motion stabl reynold number henc qualit shape curv determin author proce show simpl approxim express stabil limit obtain gener analysi given veloc profil approxim stabil limit plane poiseuil flow blasiu flow found 5906 502 reynold number base width channel displac thick respect final method comput complet instabl curv present plane poiseuil case blasiu problem work detail stabil limit blasiu flow given tollmien schlicht present exact comput agre well tollmien result far minimum critic reynold number concern valu found 420 neutral curv poiseuil motion obtain minimum critic number found 5314 agreement estim simpl criterion mention thu good discuss physic signific viscou effect futur develop conclud paper

423,an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed cones at a mach number of 5. 8.,"an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed cones at a mach number of 5. 8. shock shapes were observed and static pressures were measured on spherically-blunted cones at a nominal mach number of 5.8 over a range of reynolds numbers per inch from 97,000 to 238,000, for angles of yaw from 0 to 8 . six combinations of the bluntness ratios 0.4, 0.8, and 1.064 with the cone half angles 10, 20, and 40 were used in determining the significant parameters governing pressure distribution . the pressure distribution on the spherical nose for both yawed and unyawed bodies is predicted quite accurately by the modified newtonian theory given by, where is the angle between the normal to a surface element and the flow direction ahead of the bow shock . cone half angle was found to be the significant parameter in determining the pressure distribution near the nose-cone junction and over the conical afterbody . on the 40 spherical nosed cone models the flow overexpanded with respect to the taylor-maccoll pressure in the region of the spherical-conical juncture, after which the pressure returned rapidly to the taylor-maccoll value . for models with smaller cone angles the region of minimum pressure occurred farther back on the conical portion of the model, and the taylor-maccoll pressure was approached more gradually . the shape of the pressure distributions as described in nondimensional coordinates was independent of the radius of the spherical nose and of the reynolds number over the range of reynolds number per inch between .97 x 10 and 2.38 x 10 . integrated results for the pressure foredrag of the models at zero yaw compared very closely with the predictions of the modified newtonian approximation, except for models with large cone angles and small nose radii, where the drag approaches the value given by the taylor-maccoll theory for sharp cones .",experiment investig flow blunt nose cone mach number shock shape observ static pressur measur spheric blunt cone nomin mach number rang reynold number per inch 97 000 238 000 angl yaw six combin blunt ratio 064 cone half angl 10 20 40 use determin signific paramet govern pressur distribut pressur distribut spheric nose yaw unyaw bodi predict quit accur modifi newtonian theori given angl normal surfac element flow direct ahead bow shock cone half angl found signific paramet determin pressur distribut near nose cone junction conic afterbodi 40 spheric nose cone model flow overexpand respect taylor maccol pressur region spheric conic junctur pressur return rapidli taylor maccol valu model smaller cone angl region minimum pressur occur farther back conic portion model taylor maccol pressur approach gradual shape pressur distribut describ nondimension coordin independ radiu spheric nose reynold number rang reynold number per inch 97 10 38 10 integr result pressur foredrag model zero yaw compar close predict modifi newtonian approxim except model larg cone angl small nose radii drag approach valu given taylor maccol theori sharp cone

662,theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers .,"theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers . the effect of a strong, negative pressure gradient upon the local rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer on the isothermal surface of an electrically heated, cylindrical body of revolution with a hemispherical nose was determined from wind-tunnel tests at a mach number of 1.97 . the investigation indicated that the local heat-transfer parameter, based on flow conditions just outside the boundary layer, decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at the stagnation point of the hemisphere to a value of 0.43 0.05 at the junction with the cylindrical afterbody . because measurements of the static pressure distribution over the hemisphere indicated that the local flow pattern tended to become stationary as the free-stream mach number was increased to 3.8, this distribution of heat-transfer parameter is believed representative of all mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of temperatures less than that of dissociation . the local heat-transfer parameter was independent of reynolds number based on body diameter in the range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 . the measured distribution of heat-transfer parameter agreed within theoretical distribution calculated with foreknowledge only of the pressure distribution about the body . this method, applicable to any body of revolution with an isothermal surface, combines the mangler transformation, stewartson transformation, and thermal solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow problem, and thus evaluates the heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric compressible flow in terms of the known heat-transfer rate in an approximately equivalent two-dimensional incompressible flow . measurements of recovery-temperature distributions at mach numbers of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery factors having an average value of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which increased abruptly at the shoulder to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on the cylindrical afterbody . this result suggests that the usual representation of the laminar recovery factor as the square root of the prandtl number is conservative in the presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient .",theoret experiment investig aerodynam heat isotherm heat transfer paramet hemispher nose laminar boundari layer superson mach number effect strong neg pressur gradient upon local rate heat transfer laminar boundari layer isotherm surfac electr heat cylindr bodi revolut hemispher nose determin wind tunnel test mach number 97 investig indic local heat transfer paramet base flow condit outsid boundari layer decreas valu 65 10 stagnat point hemispher valu 43 05 junction cylindr afterbodi measur static pressur distribut hemispher indic local flow pattern tend becom stationari free stream mach number increas distribut heat transfer paramet believ repres mach number greater 97 temperatur less dissoci local heat transfer paramet independ reynold number base bodi diamet rang 6x10 3x10 measur distribut heat transfer paramet agre within theoret distribut calcul foreknowledg pressur distribut bodi method applic bodi revolut isotherm surfac combin mangler transform stewartson transform thermal solut falkner skan wedg flow problem thu evalu heat transfer rate axisymmetr compress flow term known heat transfer rate approxim equival two dimension incompress flow measur recoveri temperatur distribut mach number 97 04 yield local recoveri factor averag valu 823 012 hemispher increas abruptli shoulder averag valu 840 012 cylindr afterbodi result suggest usual represent laminar recoveri factor squar root prandtl number conserv presenc strong acceler pressur gradient

721,near noise field of a jet engine exhaust .,"near noise field of a jet engine exhaust . aircraft structures located in the near noise field of a jet engine are subjected to extremely high fluctuating pressures that may cause structural fatigue . studies of such structures have been limited by lack of knowledge of the loadings involved . the acoustic near field produced by the exhaust of a stationary turbojet engine having a high pressure ratio was measured for a single operating condition without afterburning . the maximum over-all sound pressure without afterburning was found to be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in the region immediately downstream of the jet-nozzle exit . with afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased by 50 percent . the largest sound pressures without afterburning were obtained on a constant percentage band width basis in the frequency range from 350 to 700 cps . additional tests were made at a few points to find the effect of jet velocity on near-field sound pressures and to determine the difference in value between sound-pressure levels at rigid surfaces and corresponding free-field values . near the jet nozzle, over-all sound pressures were found to vary as a low power (approx. unity) of the jet velocity . over-all sound-pressure levels considerably greater than the corresponding free-field levels were recorded at the surface of a rigid plate placed along the jet boundary . the downstream locations of the maximum sound pressure at any given frequency along the jet-engine-exhaust boundary and the longitudinal turbulent-velocity maximum of the same frequency along a small cold-air jet at 1 nozzle-exit radius from the jet axis were found to be nearly the same when compared on a dimensionless basis . also, the strouhal number of the corresponding spectra maximums was found to be nearly equal at similar distances downstream . in addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of the acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross correlation of the pressure over the surface area . cross-correlation measurements with microphones were made for a range of jet velocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the jet . free-field correlations of the over-all sound pressure and of the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps were obtained both longitudinally and laterally . in addition, correlations were obtained with microphones mounted at the surface of a rigid plate that was large compared with the distance over which a positive correlation existed . the region of positive correlation was generally found to increase with distance downstream of the engine to 6.5 nozzle-exit diameters, but remained nearly constant thereafter . in general, little change in the correlation curves was found as a function of jet velocity or frequency-band width . the distance from unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for lateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same conditions and locations . the correlation curves obtained in free space and on the surface of the plate were generally similar . the results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads on surfaces .",near nois field jet engin exhaust aircraft structur locat near nois field jet engin subject extrem high fluctuat pressur may caus structur

739,the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression .,"the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression . in two previous papers the authors have discussed in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of cylindrical and spherical shells . it was shown that not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times higher than that found by experiments, but the observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different from that predicted . furthermore, it was pointed out that the different explanations for this discrepancy advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these explanations are compared with the experimental facts . by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the authors were led to the belief that in general the buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory . this point of view was substantiated by model experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic support . the non-linear characteristics of such structures cause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitude once the structure started to buckle . thus, first of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is released once the buckling has started,. this explains the observed rapidity of the buckling process . furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations during the testing process . in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compression . first it is shown by an approximate calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops with increasing deflection . then the results of this calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of the buckling process as observed in an actual testing machine .",buckl thin cylindr shell axial compress two previou paper author discuss detail inadequaci classic theori thin shell explain buckl phenomenon cylindr spheric shell shown calcul buckl load time higher found experi observ wave pattern buckl shell also differ predict furthermor point differ explan discrep advanc donnel flugg unten certain conclus drawn explan compar experiment fact theoret investig spheric shell author led belief gener buckl phenomenon curv shell explain mean non linear larg deflect theori point view substanti model experi slender column non linear elast support non linear characterist structur caus load necessari keep shell equilibrium drop rapidli increas wave amplitud structur start buckl thu first part elast energi store shell releas buckl start explain observ rapid buckl process furthermor shown one previou paper buckl load materi reduc slight imperfect test specimen vibrat test process paper idea appli case thin uniform cylindr shell axial compress first shown approxim calcul load sustain shell drop increas deflect result calcul use detail discuss buckl process observ actual test machin

798,"interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .","interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes . the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce . some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of the paper .",interact shock wave boundari layer

(1) the effect of transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress deformation . the first of these two effects has been known to be of importance in the theory of plates and beams . the second effect was found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no counterpart in flat-plate theory . the general results of this report have been applied to the solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular cylindrical shells, and spherical shells . in each case numerical examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects of transverse shear and normal stress deformation . the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the composite shell . it was found that the changes due to transverse shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse core flexibility . the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant . solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse shear and normal stress deformation included . the present work does not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .",small bend stretch sandwich type shell theori develop small bend stretch sandwich type shell theori extens known theori homogen thin elast shell found two effect import present problem consid previous theori curv shell effect transvers shear deform effect transvers normal stress deform first two effect known import theori plate beam second effect found occur manner typic shell counterpart flat plate theori gener result report appli solut problem concern flat plate circular ring circular cylindr shell spheric shell case numer exampl given illustr magnitud effect transvers shear normal stress deform result investig indic necess take account transvers shear normal stress sandwich type shell soon order magnitud differ elast constant core layer face layer composit shell found chang due transvers shear normal stress deform core may larg mere correct result theori without transvers core flexibl actual magnitud chang greatli depend geometri load condit structur consider gener rule may given indic elast modulu ratio chang begin signific solut problem present theori may gener obtain mathemat method similar employ theori plate shell without effect transvers shear normal stress deform includ present work includ consider buckl finit deflect effect

927,investigation of normal force distributions and wake vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic speeds .,"investigation of normal force distributions and wake vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic speeds . the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in order to provide a more basic understanding of the body vortex wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing interference . the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are discussed and analyzed . comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with theories which include methods for estimating the effects of viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack . further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that, in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation . the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet . the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of equal strength, and the attendant image vortices . however, in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined from experiment . the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are, in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination angles which are in good agreement with the measured values, except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet, and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are expected . a consideration of these various regions with simple methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and experiment . it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the distribution of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are accurately known .",investig normal forc distribut wake vortex characterist bodi revolut superson speed superson aerodynam characterist inclin bodi revolut high angl attack investig order provid basic understand bodi vortex wake flow relat problem bodi wing interfer result wind tunnel test wherebi normal forc pitch moment normal forc distribut local flow properti vicin bodi determin discuss analyz comparison experiment normal forc coeffici center pressur data valu calcul accord theori includ method estim effect viscos show accuraci estim strongli depend bodi fine ratio angl attack comparison distribut theoret experiment deriv cross flow drag coeffici clearli show gener disagr experi exist theori due inadequ predict magnitud distribut forc result flow separ circul strength concentr vortic circul strength vortex feed sheet bodi vortex wake determin close contour veloc perimet integr path enclos vortex feed sheet valu vortex strength calcul manner close agreement valu predict vortex strength formula written simpl theoret model assum cross flow plane along cylindr portion bodi repres steadi incompress potenti flow cylind two symmetr vortic equal strength attend imag vortic howev comput strength necessari use vortex locat viscou normal forc distribut determin experi experiment determin valu vortex strength turn use calcul mean aforement incompress cross flow potenti local flow inclin angl good agreement measur valu except vortex core vicin feed sheet region transon cross flow veloc expect consider variou region simpl method account observ phenomena lead substanti improv agreement theori experi indic complet vortex wake flow may adequ predict bodi revolut condit repres theoret flow model provid distribut viscou normal forc vortex locat accur known
928,a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending .,"a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending . the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal deflections . experimental failure stresses range from 0.6 to 0.15 of the theoretical . the discrepancy is apparently considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens than for duralumin and increases with the radius- thickness ratio . there is an equally great discrepancy between observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections . in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is developed, which permits initial eccentricities or deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered . true instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,. the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum stress reaches the yield point . the effect of initial eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for the case of simple struts . measurements of initial eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,. however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the magnitudes of these components of the deviations . with these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio . on the basis of this a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves relations suggested by the theory but is based on experimental data . it is shown that similar discrepancies between experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation buckling problems can probably be explained by similar considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems . the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other applications as well . the paper presents the results of about a hundred new tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending, which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .",new theori buckl thin cylind axial compress bend result experi axial load cylindr shell thin enough buckl elast limit short buckl euler column good agreement previou theori base assumpt perfect initi shape infinitesim deflect experiment failur stress rang 15 theoret discrep appar consider greater brass mild steel specimen duralumin increas radiu thick ratio equal great discrep observ predict shape buckl deflect paper approxim larg deflect theori develop permit initi eccentr deviat cylindr shape consid true instabl cours imposs condit stress distribut longer uniform assum final failur take place maximum stress reach yield point effect initi eccentr larg deflect much greater case simpl strut measur initi eccentr actual cylind made howev shown discrep explain initi deviat cylindr form assum resolv doubl harmon seri certain reason assumpt made magnitud compon deviat assumpt fail stress found function yield point well modulu elast radiu thick ratio basi tent design formula proposel involv relat suggest theori base experiment data shown similar discrep experi previou theori buckl thin cylind pure bend reason explain basi maximum bend stress taken time valu given equat buckl problem probabl explain similar consider hope discuss may help open new field studi buckl problem larg deflect theori develop paper use explor field may use applic well paper present result hundr new test thin cylind axial compress bend togeth numer test lundquist form experiment evid conclus arriv

962,contributions to the theory of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer .,"contributions to the theory of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer . an approximation to the heat transfer rate across a laminar incompressible boundary layer, for arbitrary distribution of main stream velocity and of wall temperature, is obtained by using the energy equation in von mises's form, and approximating the coefficients in a manner which is most closely correct near the surface . the heat transfer rate to a portion of surface of length l breadth is given as where k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, o its prandtl number, p its density, u its viscosity, r(x) is the skin friction, and t(x) the excess of wall temperature over main stream temperature . a critical appraisement of the formula indicates that it should be very accurate for large, but that for of order 0.7 (for most gases) the constant should be replaced by 0.73, when the error should not exceed this yields a formula for nusselt number in terms of the reynolds number r and the mean square root of the skin friction coefficient c, in the case of uniform wall temperature . however, for the boundary layer with uniform main stream, the original formula is accurate to within 3 percent even for . by known transformations an expression is deducted for heat transfer to a surface, with arbitrary temperature distribution along it, and with a uniform stream outside it at arbitrary mach number (equation (42)) . from this the temperature distribution along such a surface is deduced in the case (of importance at high mach numbers) when heat transfer to it is balanced entirely by radiation from it . this calculation, which includes the solution of a non-linear integral equation, gives higher temperatures near the nose, and lower ones farther back (figure 2), than are found from a theory which assumes the wall temperature uniform and averages the heat transfer balance . this effect will be considerably mitigated for bodies of high thermal conductivity., the author is not in a position to say whether or not it will be appreciable for metal projectiles . but for stony meteorites at a certain stage of their flight through the atmosphere it indicates that melting at the nose and re-solidification farther back may occur, for which the shape and constitution of a few of them affords evidence . an appendix shows how the method for approximating and solving von mises's equation could be used to determine the skin friction as well as heat transfer rate, but this line seems to have no advantage over established approximate methods .",contribut theori heat transfer laminar boundari layer approxim heat transfer rate across laminar incompress boundari layer arbitrari distribut main stream veloc wall temperatur obtain use energi equat von mise form approxim coeffici manner close correct near surfac heat transfer rate portion surfac length breadth given thermal conduct fluid prandtl number densiti viscos skin friction excess wall temperatur main stream temperatur critic apprais formula indic accur larg order gase constant replac 73 error exceed yield formula nusselt number term reynold number mean squar root skin friction coeffici case uniform wall temperatur howev boundari layer uniform main stream origin formula accur within percent even known transform express deduct heat transfer surfac arbitrari temperatur distribut along uniform stream outsid arbitrari mach number equat 42 temperatur distribut along surfac deduc case import high mach number heat transfer balanc entir radiat calcul includ solut non linear integr equat give higher temperatur near nose lower one farther back figur found theori assum wall temperatur uniform averag heat transfer balanc effect consider mitig bodi high thermal conduct author posit say whether appreci metal projectil stoni meteorit certain stage flight atmospher indic melt nose solidif farther back may occur shape constitut afford evid appendix show method approxim solv von mise equat could use determin skin friction well heat transfer rate line seem advantag establish approxim method

1039,"on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .","on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells . an experimental investigation was made (1) to evaluate previously published theoretical procedures for the prediction of stress distribution for cases of radially symmetric abrupt change in wall thickness of thin-walled cylinders subject to internal pressure and (2) to investigate the significance of stresses attributable to the presence of thickness changes typical of design practice . one theory was adequate in itself for solution of the case of continuous middle surface,. use of the second theoretical procedure was required to determine the additional stresses arising from discontinuous middle surfaces at the change in thickness . comparisons were made between theoretical and experimental stress distributions for cases with continuous middle and continuous inner surfaces for radially symmetric changes in wall thickness of a cylinder subject to internal pressure for diameter to larger wall thickness ratios of 117 and 28 and for the case of a continuous outer surface for a ratio of 28 . in all tests the ratio of wall thicknesses at the change in wall thickness was 0.4 . there was reasonably good correlation between theoretical and experimental curves of stress distribution . on the basis of this correlation, it was concluded that the applicable theories were valid . it was shown that inclusion of the stresses arising from the condition of discontinuous middle surfaces at a change in thickness has an important effect on stress distribution . in the case of a cylinder with a continuous outer surface, the maximum mean effective stress was of sufficient magnitude to indicate that this geometry should be avoided in design if possible . the maximum mean effective stress was not increased to a significant degree by the presence of a change in wall thickness in the other cases .",transvers vibrat thin shallow elast shell experiment investig made evalu previous publish theoret procedur predict stress distribut case radial symmetr abrupt chang wall thick thin wall cylind subject intern pressur investig signific stress attribut presenc thick chang typic design practic one theori adequ solut case continu middl surfac use second theoret procedur requir determin addit stress aris discontinu middl surfac chang thick comparison made theoret experiment stress distribut case continu middl continu inner surfac radial symmetr chang wall thick cylind subject intern pressur diamet larger wall thick ratio 117 28 case continu outer surfac ratio 28 test ratio wall thick chang wall thick reason good correl theoret experiment curv stress distribut basi correl conclud applic theori valid shown inclus stress aris condit discontinu middl surfac chang thick import effect stress distribut case cylind continu outer surfac maximum mean effect stress suffici magnitud indic geometri avoid design possibl maximum mean effect stress increas signific degre presenc chang wall thick case
1040,"on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .","on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells . experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully separated wakes are presented . the afterbodies are generally similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end of the forebody . tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a range of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical flight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering models on the order of 5 ft. in diameter at about 120,000 ft. altitude . stagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r. to strictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows which would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or slightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical for a short distance and then connects with the afterbody . judiciously interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat wider applicability for approximation purposes . the results are presented and compared with each other in terms of nondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the forebody . the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be roughly uniform in each run . for a given point on an afterbody, the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or reynolds number . the present pressures and pressure-reynolds number variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and some quantitative agreement is noted . in the reynolds number range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit boundary layers were considered to be laminar . an approximate check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present tests also indicates a laminar rate . no information was obtained concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated boundary layer covering the wake . an adverse pressure gradient on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was observed . heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an afterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise direction is noted . the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end) roughly in the manner n r where generally (fig. 13) . heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost twice the values on the sides . the heat rates on the large-step body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height . in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach number square increases linearly with reynolds number . the effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody heat rates increase sharply . the expansion angle on the afterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the stepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on this body .",transvers vibrat thin shallow elast shell experiment measur pressur heat transfer rate three blunt afterbodi small

1072,ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone .,"ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone . the analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties . there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc . in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate . physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow . the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly . the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams . one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products . the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction . the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are .. (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development . since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream . however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension . the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .",ignit combust laminar mix zone analyt investig laminar combust process essenti two three dimension present mathemat difficulti howev sever exampl two dimension flame propag involv transvers veloc small comparison princip direct flow exampl occur problem flame quench cool surfac flame stabil heat flat plate combust laminar mix zone etc case problem may simplifi employ known fluid mechan boundari layer approxim sinc appli first prandtl treatment viscou flow flat plate physic consist recogn transvers veloc small variat flow properti along direct main flow small comparison direct normal main flow analyt descript problem simplifi accordingli present analysi consid ignit combust laminar mix zone two parallel move ga stream one stream consist cool combust mixtur second hot combust product two stream come contact given point laminar mix process follow veloc distribut modifi viscos temperatur composit distribut conduct diffus chemic reaction decomposit combust stream assum follow first order reaction kinet temperatur depend accord arrheniu law given initi veloc composit temperatur distribut question answer combust materi ignit far downstream initi contact point flame appear detail process develop sinc hot stream infinit extent found ignit alway take place point stream howev temperatur hot stream drop certain valu distanc requir ignit increas enorm essenti occur physic apparatu finit dimens complet develop laminar flame front comput use approxim similar integr techniqu introduc von karman boundari layer theori

1147,heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper atmosphere .,"heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper atmosphere . a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas . the particular solution was made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily extended to bodies of arbitrary shape . it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second . the effect of solar radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly important as the flight altitude is increased . at an altitude of 150 miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that determines skin temperature . owing to the strong effect of solar radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures . in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should be kept as small as possible . this may be accomplished in practice by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at small angles of attack . it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive and negative angles with respect to the flight path . as much surface as possible should be inclined at negative angles . practically, this may be accomplished by boattailing the body . in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally by emitted radiation . if the cooling rate is below the natural radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures . it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity of the skin as high as possible . this conclusion, however, is based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy . a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in thermal accommodation coefficient . this phenomenon may be used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .",heat transfer bodi travel high speed upper atmospher gener method develop use method kinet theori wherebi surfac temperatur bodi calcul steadi flight speed rarefi ga particular solut made flat plate howev calcul easili extend bodi arbitrari shape found aerodynam heat problem absenc solar radiat case nocturn flight becom neglig import altitud 125 mile higher steadi flight speed 36 000 feet per second effect solar radiat case daytim flight becom increasingli import flight altitud increas altitud 150 mile higher solar radiat predomin factor determin skin temperatur owe strong effect solar radiat skin temperatur high altitud desir nocturn flight indic order minim skin temperatur order maintain low skin temperatur found angl inclin bodi respect flight path kept small possibl may accomplish practic design bodi fine taper fli bodi small angl attack point skin temperatur may reduc insur thermal contact portion skin inclin posit neg angl respect flight path much surfac possibl inclin neg angl practic may accomplish boattail bodi event intern skin cool system employ shown rate intern cool must order magnitud greater rate heat lost natur emit radiat cool rate natur radiat rate cool littl effect upon skin temperatur shown case missil design fli wide rang altitud speed desir make emiss skin high possibl conclus howev base upon skin surfac emiss independ wave length emit absorb radiant energi possibl method reduc surfac temperatur indic decreas skin temperatur accompani decreas thermal accommod coeffici phenomenon may use advantag possibl decreas accommod coeffici alter surfac characterist skin

1201,a study of slender shapes of minimum drag using the newton-busemann pressure coefficient law .,"a study of slender shapes of minimum drag using the newton-busemann pressure coefficient law . the problem of minimizing the drag of a slender, two- dimensional or axisymmetric body in hypersonic flow at zero angle of attack is considered under the assumption that the pressure coefficient law is newton's impact law as modified by busemann in order to include centripetal acceleration effects . after the condition that the pressure coefficient be nonnegative is accounted for and after arbitrary conditions are imposed on, in addition to the thickness and the length, the enclosed area and the moment of inertia of the contour in the two-dimensional case and the wetted area and the volume in the axisymmetric case, the minimal problem is formulated as a problem of the mayer type and solved by the combined use of the euler-lagrange equations, the transversality condition, the erdmann-weierstrass corner condition, and the properties of the switching function . particular attention is devoted to the class of problems such that, among the four quantities being considered, two are prescribed while the remaining are free . for these problems, the extremal arc is composed of two subarcs .. one is characterized by a positive pressure coefficient and is called the regular shape,. the other is characterized by a zero pressure coefficient and is called the free layer . in this connection, the analysis shows the existence of two different types of solutions depending on whether the thickness is given or free . if the thickness is given, the expression for the regular shape is a power law, and the transition from the regular shape to the free layer occurs in the second half of the body . in the two- dimensional case, the exponent of the power law is 1 if the length is given if the enclosed area is given, and 3 if the moment of inertia of the contour is given,. the transition point from the power body to the free layer is located at 50 percent of the length if the length is given, at 66 percent if the enclosed area is given, and at the axisymmetric case, the exponent of the power law is if the length is given, 1 if the wetted area is given, and if the volume is given,. the transition point from the power body to the free layer is located at 60 percent of the length if the length is given, at 70 percent if the wetted area is given, and at 80 percent if the volume is given . on the other hand, for problems where the thickness is free, the equation governing the regular shape is not that of a power body, and the point of transition to the free layer is located in the first half of the body . in the two-dimensional case, the transition point is at 28 percent of the length if the length and the enclosed area are given, at 32 percent if the length and the moment of inertia of the contour are given, and at 45 percent if the enclosed area and the moment of inertia of the contour are given . in the axisymmetric case, the transition point is located at 35 percent of the length if the length and the wetted area are given, at 39 percent if the length and the volume are given, and at 46 percent if the wetted area and the volume are given . for all of the cases considered, analytical expressions are obtained for the optimum shapes, the thickness ratios, and the drag coefficients .",studi slender shape minimum drag use newton busemann pressur coeffici law problem minim drag slender two dimension axisymmetr bodi hyperson

1313,on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel .,"on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel . the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock technique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and high-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to disturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak enough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach number, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to remain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much longer than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are predicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the expansion wave originating at the diaphragm . outside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the contact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation are confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a heated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for further analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach number . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected disturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number . experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to provide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact surface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and transmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised substantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow duration may result . a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further research is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the effects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of the tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a severe limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock mach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow duration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to suppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to have alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over a range of shock mach number . it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock mach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach number of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using reflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present investigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character . further research is required to check and extend the findings, and topics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .",flow reflect shock tunnel perform shock tunnel oper reflect shock techniqu examin theoret neglect viscou effect high temperatur real ga
